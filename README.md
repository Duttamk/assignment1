## OVERVIEW
The three scripts included are for the purpose of illustrating how to work with variables and user arguments in python.

*calc_daltons.py* script performs a simple arithmetic after processing a string of protein sequence, and outputs the average weight of the protein in kilodaltons(kDa).

*calc_number_amino_acids.py* script inputs user data on name and length of a DNA sequence to output the average weight of the resulting protein, given the average weight of amino acids. It also includes a condition to manage errors where the DNA sequences are not perfectly divisible.

*dynamic_protocol.py* script inputs user arguments, which are then string formatted to output a protocol for making a solution.
